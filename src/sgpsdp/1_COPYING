Copyright Information:

Some parts of the C source code in this package  were ported partly
form NORAD's Spacetrack report #3, which included FORTRAN source for
SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8 and SDP8. According to a statement in that
report, the document is free of copyrights and open to unlimited
public distribution.

Other parts of the C source code in this package were ported from
Pascal code provided by Dr. TS. Kelso on his CelesTrack website at
http://celestrack.com/ . I have reproduced the copyright information
regarding the Pascal source I used below:

{           Author:  Dr TS Kelso }
{ Original Version:  1991 Oct 30}
{ Current Revision:  1992 Sep 03}
{          Version:  1.50 }
{        Copyright:  1991-1992, All Rights Reserved }

I make no copyright claims to the C ports in this package as I used
the above material downloaded from the Internet to produce it.
I suppose any sourcecode used from norad.c must contain the above
copyright statement by Dr. TS. Kelso.
